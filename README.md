Welcome to this repository! This is about a bot with responds with AI messages once you send them in a specific channel. The bot uses an AI called [AFFILIATE+ API](https://api.affiliateplus.xyz). If you would like to include the AI in your project open it with Autocode! If you want to include it in a different hosting you can fork this repository or simply copy the files and the code. Please join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/yEGdATHKyp) for helful support.

### Server Usage

As you know by our discord server it is called "Colen Bot Support" and doesn't have the keyword "Flurr" in it. That's because we have another Discord bot called "Colen" and its partners "Colen Games" and "Colen Music". I've worked hard for those bots so I think it deserves to join.
